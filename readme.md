## Blackjack Game

## Milestones
### Part 1 - Simulator 9/21
Write a blackjack simulator. The simulator views the game from a playerâ€™s perspective and tries to provide insights to whether to get another card or stop in various scenarios. Assuming that you are the only player, write a blackjack simulator which lists the sum of hands of the player and that of the dealer, whether to get another card, and what the probability of winning when the decision (of getting another card or of declining) is applied.
